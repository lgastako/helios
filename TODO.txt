These TODOs are organized by high-level area and then roughly by
priority within each area.

General
-------
* Think through what else should be included in every record.
* Standardize naming, terminology, etc.  Are we recording events or
  items or values or records or what? (Etc)
* Implement configuration throughout.
* Lots of unit/integration tests.
* Pretty/Thorough/Etc Documentation.


Python Clients
--------------
* Lots of unit tests.
  - Specifically there seems to be data lost when mongo and/or the
    collection server go down and come back.
  - Speed centric tests.
* Try a mechanize client? Probably not going to be good since it's not
  optimized for speed.
* Other python clients?


Report Server
-------------
Lots, including but not limited to:
* Implement a RESTful JSON-based API both that can be called by users
  but also that the report server itself will use to e.g. do dynamic
  map-reduces, charts, etc.
  * We need to get the design of this API REALLY right.


Store-and-Forward Server
------------------------
* Implement lots of unit tests.
